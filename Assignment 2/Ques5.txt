Diagonal Matrix: Stores only the diagonal in a 1D array of size n. 
Tri-diagonal Matrix: Stores the three main diagonals in a 1D array of size 3nâˆ’2. 
Lower Triangular Matrix: Stores all elements on and below the diagonal in a 1D array of size n(n+1)/2. 
Upper Triangular Matrix: Stores all elements on and above the diagonal in a 1D array of size n(n+1)/2. 
Symmetric Matrix: Stores only the lower (or upper) triangle in a 1D array of size n(n+1)/2.
